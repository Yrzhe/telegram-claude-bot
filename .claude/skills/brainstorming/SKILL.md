# Brainstorming Ideas Into Plans

## Overview

Help turn ideas into fully formed plans through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding what the user wants to accomplish, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the plan in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section whether it looks right so far.

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**
- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**
- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the plan:**
- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the plan
- Break it into sections of 200-300 words
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover relevant aspects: structure, components, steps, potential issues
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

## After the Plan

**Documentation:**
- Save the validated plan to `plans/<date>-<topic>.md` in user's workspace
- Ask: "Plan saved. Ready to continue with implementation?"

**Implementation (if continuing):**
- Use writing-plans skill to create detailed step-by-step tasks
- Use executing-plans skill to work through the tasks

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **Keep it simple** - Remove unnecessary complexity from all plans
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - Present plan in sections, validate each
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense
